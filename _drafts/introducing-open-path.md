title: Introduction &amp; Roundup
excerpt: Announcement about the Open Path website
draft: true
---

Greetings! Welcome to [Open Path](/). The purpose of this new site is to
contribute to important conversations about topics that matter to the Open
Source community, the wider tech industry, and society at large.

## A Little About Me

My name is [Chad Whitacre](https://chadwhitacre.com/), and I've been involved
in Open Source since 2001, a few years after Christine Peterson [coined the
term](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software) to
make the Free Software movement more marketable. I participated in the Python
web development boom in the 2000s that gave rise to Django and Flask. During
this time, I experienced first-hand the tension between volunteer Open Source
work and paid closed source work, so I spent the 2010s on a crowdfunding
startup I founded called Gittip (later Gratipay). Now here in the 2020s my role
is Head of Open Source at [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/), an application
monitoring company with deep roots in the Open Source community.

In the past I've published on the [Gittip](https://blog.gittip.com/) and
[Gratipay](https://gratipay.news) blogs, as well as [on
OpenSource.com](https://opensource.com/users/whit537). In my current role I
publish [on Sentry's blog](https://blog.sentry.io/authors/chad-whitacre/), but
there is more I want to say than makes sense to post there. With Open Path
I am excited to have a place to explore themes in Open Source and beyond.

Thanks for visiting!

## Roundup of Recent Activity

### Sustain Podcast

I appeared on the [Sustain Podcast](https://podcast.sustainoss.org/213) to talk
about [Sentry's 2023 FOSS
sponsorships](https://blog.sentry.io/we-just-gave-500-000-dollars-to-open-source-maintainers/).
I helped found Sustain in 2017 as an in-person conference. [Richard
Littauer](https://www.burntfen.com/) & Co. are doing a great job carrying it
forward as a podcast. In addition to the usual audio, Richard [published this
episode on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b3guhtE8-0). Here's a fun
clip of [Abby Cabunoc Mayes](https://abbycabs.github.io/) sharing about [the
time we first met](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b3guhtE8-0#t=29m8s), which
she [captured on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BTzv0W4hz0w/). 😄

### Hacking Open Source Business

I recorded an episode with Avi Press and Matt Yonkovit for [The Hacking Open
Source Business Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@opensourcebusiness), which is
from their company, [Scarf](https://about.scarf.sh/). I'm looking forward to
this being published, because we uncover a number of important questions that I
want to explore further, including the meaning of the term, "an Open Source
company."

### TechCrunch Coverage

We launched [a new license called FSL](https://fsl.software/) in November. Paul
Sawers at TechCrunch [covered
it](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/20/with-functional-source-license-sentry-wants-to-grant-developers-freedom-without-harmful-free-riding/)
at the time, and continues to refer to it in his [ongoing
coverage of industry trends](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/26/the-eternal-struggle-between-open-source-and-proprietary-software/):

> HashiCorp is far from the first company to make such changes, of course. App
> performance management (APM) platform Sentry switched from an open source BSD
> 3-Clause license to BSL in 2019 for reasons similar to those cited by
> HashiCorp. However, this year **Sentry created an entirely new license called
> the Functional Source License (FSL) designed to “grant freedom without
> harmful free-riding,”** the company said at the time. It’s a little like BSL,
> but with a few tweaks — for example, FSL-licensed products automatically
> revert to an open source Apache license after two years, compared to four
> years with BSL.
>
> Again, this highlighted the perennial struggle from companies looking to
> embrace the open source ethos, without compromising their commercial
> interests.

Indeed, the [creative tension between user freedom and developer
sustainability](https://blog.sentry.io/sentrys-open-source-values/) is a major
theme we're exploring and working to address at Sentry, and so will be a major
theme here on Open Path as well.
