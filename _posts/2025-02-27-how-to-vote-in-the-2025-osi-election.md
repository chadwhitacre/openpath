I'm running in the [Open Source Initiative (OSI) Board of Directors
election](https://opensource.org/blog/get-ready-to-vote-for-osis-board-of-directors-in-2025).
I intend to say more next week about _why_ you should vote and what I am bringing to
the table. For now I wanted to get the word out about _how_ to vote.

Voting is open to all [dues-paying
members](https://members.opensource.org/join/) of the OSI. There are two "full"
(aka paid) membership levels:

1. Supporting for $50/year, and
2. Professional for $300/yr.

There is a Basic tier that's free but doesn't carry voting privileges. The link
to vote will go out in email on March 7, and **voting closes on March 17 at 5:00
UTC**. The candidates should be announced tomorrow (February 28) and the results
should be announced by March 24.

If you care about Open Source—whether Open Source AI, or open-washing, or [the
Open Source sustainability
crisis](https://openpath.quest/2024/the-open-source-sustainability-crisis/), or
any of a number of other issues—[join OSI before March
7](https://members.opensource.org/join/) and watch your email to vote in the
election by March 17. Let's move Open Source forward together!
