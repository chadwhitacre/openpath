title: Leadership and Power in Open Source
excerpt: Open Source offers a check on power, yet some ways of wielding power are still better than others.
---

Last week I waded into the Great WordPress Drama of 2024 with a post comparing
Matt Mullenweg's leadership of WordPress with Dries Buytaert's leadership of
Drupal. My conclusion was that [Matt does not share power](/2024/a-tale-of-two-leaders/).

Besides Dries, another key interlocutor of Matt's during this crisis is David
Heinemeier Hansson, whose name I have yet to be able to spell confidently
without checking, despite having followed his work and crossed paths a bit
since 2004. DHH, let's call him. Shall we?

Matt published [a reply to DHH](https://ma.tt/2024/10/on-dhh/) today [update:
Matt took down the original], which sorta is-what-it-is, par for the course in
the fight Matt is waging. What I found more interesting was [this related
post](https://ma.tt/2019/10/debating-oss-with-dhh/) from 2019, about a
conversation Matt had with DHH on the Rework Podcast entitled, "[Open Source
and Power with Matt
Mullenweg](https://37signals.com/podcast/open-source-and-power-with-matt-mullenweg/)."

The context was Automattic's Series D, and an emerging narrative around growing
WordPress from 34% of the web to 85%. Today WordPress is at 57%, so Matt is
right on track, I guess. At the time, David rankled at one company
consolidating so much power. A Twitter exchange evolved into [the podcast
episode](https://37signals.com/podcast/open-source-and-power-with-matt-mullenweg/).
tl;dr Matt _really_ does not share power&mdash;except when he does, then he
_really_ does.

## Evil Monopoly Stuff

There are some quotes in Matt and David's call that are really juicy in light
of the current crisis. Here's the juiciest, at 13:32:

> And the truth is that if I had an evil hat on—like let’s say I started doing
> evil monopoly stuff—people could easily fork the software, and they would ...
> tomorrow! So there’s a checks and balances there.

David pushed back on the feasability of a fork against such a large incumbent,
but today we have Valkey and OpenTofu as existence proofs that it can and will be
done. Who among us will be surprised if and when Linux Foundation and WP Engine
[announce OpenPress](https://x.com/jessethanley/status/1839087749271531655) or
whatever?

Here's the kicker: **Any fork, _especially_ if WP Engine backs it, will be a
win for Matt**. It means they're finally contributing. Since it's GPL their
modifications are available to everyone else, including Automattic. And it's
what Matt has said all along. Here he is at 49:25:

It's hard for me to fault his main point. Personally, I can't stand WordPress
as a software product. It really frustrates me every time I have to use it. So
I don't, for the most part. That's me opting out of Matt's power. If I did love
WordPress and didn't like what Matt is doing, I would think about contributing
to a fork. He's right that Open Source provides a meaningful check-and-balance
that, e.g., Mark Zuckerberg does not have. David finds this to be "[uncharted
and dangerous territory for open
source](https://x.com/dhh/status/1845197490829889605)," but I'm not sure it's
not fine. Matt is being quite aggressive, yes. But WP Engine really was a
"Taker," in Dries'
[terminology](https://dri.es/solving-the-maker-taker-problem). Dries' patient,
thoughtful approach to resolving the Maker/Taker problem is inspiring to me.
Matt's tyrannical approach is not. But I'm free to opt out of Matt's power, so
what's the problem?

In Matt's [reply to DHH](https://ma.tt/2024/10/on-dhh/) [update: Matt took down
the original], he called out David and Dries for holding the trademarks for
Ruby on Rails and Drupal, rather than vesting those with their respective
foundations.  He has a point there, as well.

What I'm seeing here is a clarification of ways to lead in Open Source, ways to
wield power. I'm grateful that I can opt out of people's power in Open Source,
and I trust that the best ways of wielding it will win out over time.

## P.S. Yay For More Emotional Bandwidth

By the way, I love that we're finally learning to do this, to move
conversations from text-based online communication, which has low emotional
bandwidth, to podcasts and video calls, which have higher emotional bandwidth.
Just the other week I did two of these, with [Peer
Richelsen](https://x.com/chadwhitacre_/status/1839348202660638802) and with
[Pete from Hugging Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdUfB-hBoqk).  I first
experienced the power of this practice [back in 2013, with
DHH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1E-svVd9Xc), in fact. We talked about
[mixing Open Source and
money](https://dhh.dk/2013/the-perils-of-mixing-open-source-and-money.html),
which is [still highly
relevant](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/10/14/mixing-oss-and-money/).

{% include img.html src="open-call.webp" caption="Streamed 10 years ago." url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1E-svVd9Xc" %}

The roots go back much further. The term [emotional bandwidth is Mitch Kapor's,
from 1995](https://tricycle.org/magazine/emotional-bandwidth/). Mitch was
wrestling with the tension between the promise of the early Internet to bring
people together, and the reality of the flamewars and conflict that we ended up
in, even back then. "The answer," he wrote, "may lie in increasing the emotional
bandwidth of communication." But he could only dream of the future we're living
in today:

> As telephone systems are upgraded and cable television becomes an access path
> to the Internet, higher speed connections capable of carrying voice and face
> will become much more common.

We're pretty accustomed to dropping to a call in our work lives, inside our
companies. It's great progress that we're starting to see more of this in
public life as well. Hopefully someday national presidential politics will
catch up. ;-)
