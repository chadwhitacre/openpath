title: Open Source Is a Restaurant
excerpt: It was a great meal. Are we going to pay the tab?
---

With [XZ](https://research.swtch.com/xz-timeline) we're in a fresh round of
proposals to fix [Open Source
sustainability](/2024/the-open-source-sustainability-crisis/).
One thing I'm seeing more of this time around is an appetite for tax-based
approaches. Tim Bray proposes
[OSQI](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/04/01/OSQI). Matthew Hodgson also
calls for [government
funding](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/04/open-source-publicly-funded-service/).
I've pitched a weird hybrid "[voluntary
tax](/2024/a-vision-for-software-commons/)."

Europe is (unsurprisingly) further along with [tax-based
approaches](https://openfuture.eu/policies-for-the-digital-commons/public-digital-infrastructure-fund/)
than the United States. [Sovereign Tech
Fund](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/) is off and running in Germany.
[FOSSEPS](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/fosseps/news/funding-sustainability)
seems to be coming along behind at the EU scope.

Tax-based programs tend to be grant-driven, similar to what we see with
industrial philanthropies in the U.S. such as the [Sloan
Foundation](https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology). With this model,
maintainers apply for funding for a certain scope of work, and the government
or charity follows up to ensure the work they are funding gets done. It's
basically the tried and true consulting model for subsidizing Open Source, but
with a government (or non-profit) as the client.

Grant programs do not get us
to [sustainability as I define it](/2024/the-open-source-sustainability-crisis/#what-is-open-source-sustainability):

> Open Source sustainability is when any smart, motivated person can produce
> widely adopted Open Source software and get paid fairly without jumping
> through hoops.

Grants are [hoops](https://openpath.chadwhitacre.com/2024/the-open-source-sustainability-crisis/#whats-wrong-with-hoops).

## The Restaurant Analogy

I've hit upon an analogy that I think clarifies our situation. It's
[buried](/2024/a-vision-for-software-commons/#the-restaurant-analogy) in "A
Vision for Software Commons," but there's a lot going on there and I think this
is a good enough idea to warrant its own post.

### Not a Grocery Store

Open Source is not a <b>grocery store</b>. At a grocery store (or pretty much
any other store, but this analogy works best if we use food), you pay _first_,
then you get to eat.

This is analogous to thinking of payments to Open Source projects in terms of
ROI: what am I getting in the future for the money I am paying now? This
doesn't work, because you _already used the software_. You can pay for other
things _adjacent to_ the software—consulting, packaging, hosting, and so forth.
These _subsidize_ Open Source but do not directly _sustain_ it. ROI as a
mechanism depends on scarcity, and Open Source is essentially, intentionally
non-scarce.

### Not a Soup Kitchen

Open Source is not a <b>soup kitchen</b>. Payments to Open Source projects are
not donations, they are not charity. They would be if someone else ate the
meal, but you ate it.

Companies are by definition not geared towards making charitable donations.
Yes, corporate philanthropy is a thing. It's peanuts. I'm seeing maybe [$25
billion/year](https://doublethedonation.com/types-of-corporate-philanthropy/),
on a U.S. economy of [$25 _trillion_](https://www.google.com/search?q=us+gdp) a
year. Open Source likely accounts for [100s of billions of this
value](https://gratipay.news/open-source-captures-almost-none-of-the-value-it-creates-9015eb7e293e)
and currently recoups [100s of
millions](https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2751-the-state-of-funding-free-open-source-software/slides/22659/State_of_FOSS_Funding_FOSDEM_2024_IQwHRvb.pdf)
(PDF). We need to grow Open Source income by several orders of magnitude.
Calling it charity is a doomed approach. Fortunately, it's also not accurate.

### A Restaurant

Open Source is a <b>restaurant</b>. At a restaurant, you eat your meal _first_,
and _then_ you are expected to pay for it. Yes, we could dine and dash. But we
don't. When presented with a tab for a meal we have just eaten, we pay
the tab.

Now picture a meal with a large group of friends. Inevitably, someone forgot
their wallet—or &ldquo;forgot&rdquo; &ldquo;their&rdquo; &ldquo;wallet.&rdquo;
The rest of the group has to pick up their share. Sometimes, one person gets
stuck with the whole tab.

Our companies are sitting around the table. Open Source is the meal we consume
year after year. **We need to [split the
check](/2024/a-vision-for-software-commons/#splitting-the-check-with-a-fair-share)**.
Be careful here: I'm _not_ saying we should _tip_ Open Source projects. I'm saying
we should _pay our bill_. If some companies want to tip extra, more power to them.

### Residential ⇒ Commercial ⇒ Collective

Hobby projects are akin to residential kitchens. Mounting expectations such as
[CRA](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act)
and [EO
14028](https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-14028-improving-nations-cybersecurity)
are akin to OSHA inspections. We need Open Source foundations to
become commercial kitchens, as it were, fit to deliver at scale. At the same
time, we need foundations to find ways of funding individuals that [fit the
Open Source ethos of collaborative
autonomy](/2024/a-vision-for-software-commons/#the-heart-of-open-source). If
Open Source is to be a restaurant, let it be the [Moosewood
Collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moosewood_Restaurant).

## A New Bucket

Companies already have a few big buckets that make sense to them to
account for money they spend:

- <b>Taxes</b>—they pay because they have to or (at some point) they'll be disciplined by government.
- <b>Purchases</b>—they pay because they want the product or service they are buying.
- <b>Donations</b>—they pay because ... well, they don't really, if we're honest. It's couch pennies.

We need a new bucket:

- <b>Fair Share</b>—they pay because, at the very least, they don't want to be
  seen by their peers as deadbeats.

Look, don't get me wrong. This is a _huge honkin' deal_. We're essentially
asking our corporations to become a _little teensy tiny bit_ less sociopathic than they
currently by nature are. Everything is against us. There's no way this could
possibly work. Unless enough of us collectively want it to work.

I want it to work.
