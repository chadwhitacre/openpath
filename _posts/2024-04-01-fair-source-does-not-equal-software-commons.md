title: Fair Source <> Software Commons
excerpt: Fair Source is about licensing. Software Commons is about funding. Let's do both ... separately.

Yes, it is April 1. No, this is not an April Fools Joke. This is a quick post
to clear up a misconception about [Software
Commons](https://softwarecommons.com/) that stems from the historical evolution
of the name. If you weren't there for it, then hopefully you aren't confused by
it, and this post will be stating the obvious for you.  If you were, hopefully
this helps disentangle what was admittedly a bit of a convoluted discussion.

"Software Commons"
[emerged](https://github.com/getsentry/fsl.software/issues/2#issuecomment-1939112531)
out of [work we were doing](https://github.com/getsentry/fsl.software/issues/2)
to [find a name other than Open
Source](https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1687113805237714944) to [label
Codecov](https://blog.sentry.io/lets-talk-about-open-source/) and projects like
it, which are shared in meaningful ways but ultimately controlled by one company.
Turns out it is better to name two separate approaches to balancing [Sentry's
values](https://blog.sentry.io/sentrys-open-source-values/) of user freedom and
developer sustainability:

- [**Fair Source**](https://fair.io/) is the term we are converging on to
celebrate companies meaningfully sharing their core products using non-compete
licenses (the original context in which the name "Software Commons"
arose, hence the confusion).

- [**Software Commons**](https://softwarecommons.com/) has become about bringing
together companies, foundations, and platforms to solve [the Open Source
sustainability
crisis](https://openpath.chadwhitacre.com/2024/the-open-source-sustainability-crisis/).

I had initially tried to see these two aspects of sustainability—licensing and
funding—as worth pursuing together. Now I see them as worth pursuing
separately. Neither is an attempt to change the fundamental definitions of
[Free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#fs-definition) and [Open
Source](https://opensource.org/osd) Software.

Sorry for the confusion!
