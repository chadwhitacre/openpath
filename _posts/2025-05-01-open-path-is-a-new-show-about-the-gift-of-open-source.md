Open Source is a gift that's greater than we realize. Truly accepting it could heal the world. That's the premise of my new show, [Open Path](https://openpath.quest/), which launched today on [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/). The first episode is pretty personal, about how I came to be leading the Open Source Pledge. I'm hoping future episodes will amplify our attempts to grow the Pledge. Want to be part of the story?
