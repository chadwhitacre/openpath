This is a response to Luke Faraone's post, "[I'm running for the OSI board...
maybe](https://blog.luke.wf/2025/02/im-running-for-osi-board-maybe.html)."

I tried
leaving this as a comment on Luke's blog, but only members of the blog may post
comments.

And yes I'm running for an individual board seat.

### My Comment for Luke's Blog

I received the following email from OSI on February 14. It looks to me like a
generic email sent to the whole membership list, and the timezone is clearly
defined. Your post does explain some of Bradley's questions on the call,
though. ;-)

Were you a member of OSI on February 14? Did you receive this email?
