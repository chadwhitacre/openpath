title: Thank You, Ben
excerpt: Ben Vinegar hired me into Sentry four years ago, and now he is moving on. Allow me a few words.

One of my favorite books on leadership is <cite><a
href="https://www.bysamwalker.com/the-captain-class">The Captain
Class</a></cite>, by <a href="https://www.bysamwalker.com/">Sam Walker</a>. It
is a delightfully thorough study of the top sports dynasties of all time. Based
on a number of criteria—teams of 5+ players, competing at a national or
international level, winning 4+ annual championships in a row—it turns out
there are only 17 truly elite teams in sports history.

The thesis of the book is that it's not a star player or a brilliant coach that
sets legendary teams apart. No, it's rather the presence of an exceptional
**captain**, a player with an extreme drive to win, who commands the respect of his
or her teammates and works relentlessly to level up everyone else, in ways that
the crowd never sees.

<a href="https://benv.ca/">Ben Vinegar</a> was not the founder or CEO or CTO of
Team Sentry. He was the captain.

Thanks for hiring me in, Ben, and for a great run. All the best on what's next.
