excerpt: We may have just witnessed the end of the Republic, with the accession of Augustus Musk.

Yesterday I [commented on point
four](/2025/point-four-of-elons-fork-is-the-scary-one/) of Elon Musk's "[Fork
in the Road](https://www.opm.gov/fork)" document.
"[Fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))" is a
technical term in Open Source software that refers to a schism in the community
behind a project.

[suggest](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/)
that point four may indeed signal [the end of the rule of
law](/2025/point-four-of-elons-fork-is-the-scary-one/) in the United States of
America. What comes after? Empire.

## Hail Caesar

Elon thinks about the Roman Empire [every
day](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/16k06r1/elon_says_he_thinks_about_the_roman_empire_every/).
His supporters call his controversial gesture at the inauguration [a Roman
salute](https://theconversation.com/elon-musk-and-the-history-of-the-roman-salute-248032).

The [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic) gave way to
the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) in 27 BC, when
Octavian took the title [Augustus
Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus):

> The reign of Augustus initiated an imperial cult, as well as an era of

I strongly suspect that in Elon's mind, January 20, 2025 was the end of the
American Republic, and the birth of the American Empire. He likely thinks of
himself as having forked the United States, as Octavian did Rome.

## So What?

A few brief comments on what seems (from so close to it) to be one of the
pivotal moments of human history:

1. Many accept Musk's rise to power as good news.

1. I don't see this change being forcibly reverted. The noise from those who
   don't accept Musk will likely subside to a manageable simmer relatively soon.

1. [Unlike Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Actium), this transition
   happened without an overt war, which is good.

1. Elon seems to me likely to succeed in making the U.S. more efficient and
   effective, based on his success with Twitter and his other companies.

1. Elon is likely to use his new power primarily to pursue his [interplantary
   agenda](https://nss.org/elon-musk-making-humans-a-multiplanetary-species/).

1. In empires, succession is often inefficient. Clearly Musk has positioned
   himself to succeed (preempt?) Trump. Who succeeds Musk? According to what
   process?

1. It hasn't happened yet, but Elon indicated he would return Twitter to a public
   company after reorganizing it as X. Is there a world in which he returns the
   U.S. to a republic once he has run his course?

1. This is a salient time to worship a deity other than Caesar.
