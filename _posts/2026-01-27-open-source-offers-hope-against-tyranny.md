I took a break this past weekend. I set my phone down on Friday, and didn’t
pick it up again until Monday morning. One of the first things I saw when I
logged on was [this
tweet](https://x.com/gvanrossum/status/2015212516281049487) from Guido van
Rossum, creator of the Python programming language:

> The revolution apparently will start in Minnesota. I would not have expected
that. Yay Minnesotans!

That was the first inkling I had about the second killing of an American
citizen this month by ICE agents in Minneapolis. First, [Renée
Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Ren%C3%A9e_Good), now [Alex
Pretti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Alex_Pretti). As I caught up
with the tragic news, I felt increasingly out-of-tune
[talking](https://x.com/chadwhitacre/status/2015814847372390575) about
[adventures with surfers in
Malibu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Eq784mX5KU), as fun as that might be.

What could Open Source possibly have to say to a world teetering on the brink
of chaos in a thousand different directions?

Last fall I traveled the world in search of an answer to this question. I went
to Los Angeles, Denmark, India, and Ukraine. The result is my first
documentary, *[Gift Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOn-L3tGKw0)*:

The documentary does a lot, and I’m okay with it being more evocative than
prescriptive. That said, the point I hope it makes is that Open Source _does_
have something to offer the wider world.

If Open Source only makes humanity more efficient through shared technical
knowledge, then no, Open Source does nothing related to mainstream news other
than distracting from it. I believe it does more. I believe it exhibits
political and economic relations that can bring humanity to a better place. I
believe its lessons should be widely shared.

## Learning From Open Source Leaders

In the documentary, I tried to highlight leaders I really admire in the Open
Source community, who concretely show what I want the mainstream future to look
like. People like legendary developer <b>Poul-Henning Kamp</b>, who watched
a company go public for $2 billion on top of his Open Source work, and felt
“[not one shred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOn-L3tGKw0#t=29m58s)” of
resentment.  Or <b>Kailash Nadh</b>, the [spiritually
attuned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOn-L3tGKw0#t=57m21s) CTO of India’s
largest stock broker.  Or <b>Alex Blokh</b>, co-founder of Drizzle: a Russian
missile killed his neighbor and blew out 15 windows in his own home, yet from
his struggles he has refined [an inner
strength](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOn-L3tGKw0#t=1h01m53s) that I have
everything to learn from.

We have [our share of demagogues and
tyrants](https://openpath.quest/2024/leadership-and-power-in-open-source/) in
Open Source, and we let them suck up the oxygen in the room sometimes. But we
also have many, many wonderful role models—none perfect, but many worth holding
up, celebrating, and emulating. We even have examples of leaders exhibiting
personal growth over time, Linus himself [chief among
them](https://www.jonobacon.com/2018/09/16/linus-his-apology-and-why-we-should-support-him/).

In a world where tyrants and strongmen increasingly shock us and demand our
attention, Open Source suggests that we can focus elsewhere: not as a
distraction, but as a decision to invest in the world we want. [With Mark
Carney](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/davos-2026-special-address-by-mark-carney-prime-minister-of-canada/),
we can take Václav Havel’s proverbial sign out of the window:

> The system's power comes not from its truth, but from everyone's willingness
to perform as if it were true, and its fragility comes from the same source.

In the Open Source community around the world, I found people performing as if
other realities are true: the reality of community, the reality of liberty, the
reality of belonging, the reality of constructive resilience, the reality of
humility in leadership, the reality of overcoming resentment, the reality of
gratitude and generosity, the reality of inner strength and peace. Tyranny
stands no chance against such things. Let’s do more of those!
