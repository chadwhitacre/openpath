One Sunday evening last June, [three
friends met](https://x.com/steipete/status/1934357642899521713) in Vienna to
relive the glory days: [coding all night](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/vibetunnel-turn-any-browser-into-your-mac-terminal).
This time, Claude joined them.


{% include img.html src="team.jpg" caption="(l. to r.) Peter, Armin, Mario, Claude(s)."

%}

[**Armin Ronacher**](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/about/) planted the seed for what
[emerged](https://x.com/mitsuhiko/status/1934670797710479716) as
[VibeTunnel](https://vibetunnel.sh/) the next morning. [**Mario
Zechner**](https://mariozechner.at/) went on [two months
later](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/commit/a74c5da112c29466f182a03108337a488c785d76)
to create [Pi](https://shittycodingagent.ai/), a coding agent. [**Peter
Steinberger**](https://steipete.me/), captain of the June team, was standing on Pi's
shoulders on [November
24](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/commit/f6dd362d39b8e30bd79ef7560aab9575712ccc11)
when he started what became [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/). That was also the
day Anthropic [released Opus
4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5).

OpenClaw 
[exploded](https://www.star-history.com/#codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x&torvalds/linux&type=date&legend=top-left).
The spotlight on Peter is [bright](https://x.com/georgepickett/status/2019445652363542911) [indeed](https://x.com/lexfridman/status/2021785659644453136).

(For the record: Armin is [a
friend](https://x.com/mitsuhiko/status/1836413328702202276). He and I first discussed
agentic coding at Sentry HQ back in October, 2022, when I prototyped [Robb
Oat](https://archive.ph/XUhTn). I haven't met Mario or Peter.) 

I watched all this from the sidelines because I was busy [making a
documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOn-L3tGKw0). Since releasing that
on January 20, I've been catching up on the latest developments in agentic
coding and beyond. What does it mean for Open Source? I see talk of [slop
PRs](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/185387) and [outright
spam](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/26/slop-acts-of-kindness/) and of
course the [death of Open Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15494)
([again](https://heathermeeker.com/2023/10/30/rumors-of-the-death-of-open-source-are-greatly-exaggerated/)).
What's going on here?

## Reeling From a Sip

I figured I'd better taste the Kool-Aid in order to form an opinion, so I dove
into Claude Code with Opus 4.5 on a side project. I spent three 12+ hour days
with it. I was intoxicated. My family was weirded out.
[Observing](https://x.com/chadwhitacre/status/2017021563770405198) how
[expensive](https://x.com/chadwhitacre/status/2017429682757537907) it is, I
decided to time-box my usage. I gave myself two more days to ship an MVP of
this side project, and then I would shift to writing up a blog post about my
experience with agentic coding and my thoughts on its impact on Open Source.

I unplugged for a long weekend. I spent Monday evening and Tuesday with it
again, and this time got so bogged down in bugs that I gave up on shipping an
MVP in the time allotted.

{% include img.html src="seals.webp" caption="Nothing left but the sprites, courtesy of Nano Banana." %}

I took a step back to reflect on what I had just experienced. That was the day
Peter's [SF pilgrimage](https://x.com/steipete/status/2017790488666116514)
erupted into the [first](https://x.com/francedot/status/2017271738401534310),
[white-hot](https://x.com/georgepickett/status/2019445652363542911)
[ClawCon](https://luma.com/moltbot-sf-show-tell). The pull was so strong I felt
it even in Pittsburgh. I fled the agentic vortex. How far would I have to go to
gain enough perspective to gather my true thoughts?

I drove north through [a deadly
snowstorm](https://triblive.com/local/regional/1-dead-in-18-vehicle-crash-on-i-79/)
on Friday, spent the night at my inlaws' empty house (they're in Florida), and
in the morning sought out an old Amish friend. I beached the car in three snow drifts.
Three times Amish appeared to heave me out. The last one tried hitching his
horse.


## Aaron's Table

I abandoned the car and walked the last mile, wind whipping deep drifts and
deeper chill. Subzero. Stark sun. My reward: spelt raisin cookies and peanuts
from the field outside, at Aaron's kitchen table. "Tell me, what is the World
Wide Web?  How would you explain it to a cabbage farmer? I've been studying up
a lot lately. A web is a snare, isn't it? Why can't I seem to escape it, even
out here? What is money anymore except a number in cyberspace?"

{% include img.html src="materials.webp" caption="Also pictured: Issue 1 of <i>The Analog Times</i>." url="https://www.analogsunday.co/" %}

I left with many gifts, least among them three books. Two are mine to keep:
<i>The Complete Works of Menno Simon</i>, and <i>Hope Thou In God: Help for
Depression From the Psalms and Other Scriptures (Study Questions Included)</i>.
Yes, the Amish are not unfamiliar with depression and mental illness. The third
book is to be returned, a zine from the 1990s called <i>Why We Live Simply</i>.
From pages 23--24:

> There is no reason to think that the process of change has reached its peak.
> The snowball effect is sure to continue---every discovery and invention opens
> the door to dozens more. If the world stands, there will almost certainly be
> greater changes ahead in the next fifty years than we have seen during the
> past one hundred and fifty years. There is no reason to think that any end is
> in sight until the arrival of The End.

I spent Saturday night and Sunday re-engaging with society (the Super Bowl
"helped"). On Monday I started drafting this post from my local library,
hard-won clarity in hand. Long story short, **I've decided to dial back my
engagement with mainstream technology, and to launch a print magazine called
_Gift_** to network with like-minded individuals.

{% include img.html src="library.webp" caption="Remember libraries?" %}

I see two trajectories in technology, either of which alone is off-putting.
Considered together, it's enough for me to draw the line. What are the trends,
and what is the line?

## The Attachment Iceberg

My friend Aza Raskin cofounded the [Center for Humane
Technology](https://www.humanetech.com/) (CHT) with Tristan Harris. The organization
[began](https://www.humanetech.com/impact-and-story) when Tristan, working at
Google, decided to act on his observation of the "detrimental effects of
attention-harvesting design" in social media. They now have AI in view as well.
What they see is [a crashing wave of attachment
disorders](https://centerforhumanetechnology.substack.com/p/the-attachment-economy-is-here-were),
due to AI agents "designed to exploit our most fundamental
psychological vulnerabilities [at] an unprecedented scale."

> We’ve been here before. Social media was our first mass experiment with AI
> and it created the **attention** economy, leaving us with a loneliness epidemic,
> rising political polarization, and fractured attention spans. Now we’re
> running the same experiment with something far more dangerous: AI companions
> able to hack the **attachment** system that shapes our identity and bonds us to
> others.

Peter, Mario, and Armin—leaders of the charge—have all shared their personal
experiences with the psychological downsides of agentic AI. "If there’s
anything I can read out of the insane stream of messages I get, it’s that AI
psychosis is a thing and needs to be taken serious," [said
Peter](https://x.com/steipete/status/2018035483960369161). In 
"[Just One More
Prompt](https://steipete.me/posts/just-one-more-prompt)," he wrote, "AI was supposed to save time, yet I work more than ever before, I have more
FOMO than ever before. I dedicate pretty much all my waking time to this, yet
it doesn’t feel enough."

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If there’s anything I can read out of the insane stream of messages I get, it’s that AI psychosis is a thing and needs to be taken serious.</p>&mdash; Peter Steinberger 🦞 (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/2018035483960369161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Mario [chimed in](https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/2020275522182217887), "The
winners will be those, who can sustain a healthy life style and not give in to
the slot machine unconditionally." But Armin opened up about just how difficult
this is, in a section of [his 2025
recap](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/12/22/a-year-of-vibes/) called "The
Machine And Me": "I increasingly find it harder not to create parasocial bonds
with some of the tools I use. I find this odd and discomforting." He develops
the theme much further in "[Agent Psychosis: Are We Going
Insane?](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2026/1/18/agent-psychosis/)" The conclusion
is chilling:

> Maybe this is just the awkward transition phase before we figure out new
norms.
>
> Or maybe some of us are genuinely losing the plot, and we won’t know
which camp we’re in until we look back. All I know is that when I watch someone
at 3am, running their tenth parallel agent session, telling me they’ve never
been more productive — in that moment I don’t see productivity. I see someone
who might need to step away from the machine for a bit. And I wonder how often
that someone is me.

Some developers, like [Salvatore Sanfilippo](https://antirez.com/news/158) and
[Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/writing/my-ai-adoption-journey),
seem unperturbed by the psychological rip tide. I'm not as strong. After a few
days locked in a productive embrace with AI agents, I resonate with the
warnings of the dangers of disordered attachment.

## The Machine Starts 

The use of the word "machine" in reflections on AI is telling. While the tech
industry was molting OpenClaw, my daughter and I read _[Against the
Machine](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/756181/against-the-machine-by-paul-kingsnorth/)_,
a Christmas gift from a friend, a grumpy rant against headlong technological
acceleration. The word is also used in _The Matrix_. Both hearken to E.M.
Forster's classic novella, _[The Machine
Stops](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~koehl/Teaching/ECS188/PDF_files/Machine_stops.pdf)_,
in which the mass of humanity live encased in cells, fed through a tube,
evacuating through another, while handheld screens permit them to discuss
"ideas" with one another. The few outside the Machine are Homeless.

We're on our way.

Creeping vines [seem to have
agency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlqqZZ7q4-s) in timelapse. I imagine
technology in a century-long timelapse, a tentacled monster forcing itself into
our orifices. Screens went from massive CRTs sitting on our floor, to LCDs on
our wall, to laptops on our lap, to smartphones in our hand, to smart glasses
on our face, to VR goggles covering our face, and now Neuralink is preparing
[clinical trials of
Blindsight](https://neuralink.com/trials/visual-prosthesis/). I wrote a song
about this progression with my friend Kirk Botula:

{% include youtube.html video_id="op-G-1JuXOg" %}

This second trajectory---tech invading our bodies, embalming us into
machine-dependent cyborgs---dovetails with the first. It's hard to imagine
agentic AI _not_ finding its way into our brains, a constant companion
throughout life. "I operate as one half of [a human-AI
dyad](https://x.com/i_need_api_key/status/2017311428735045852) with my human."

Yeah, no thanks. I'm gonna go ahead and tap out.

## My Amish Moment

The CHT piece [tries to be constructive](https://centerforhumanetechnology.substack.com/i/186036567/theres-a-better-way-forward):

I am settling into the conviction that "we" will not make the necessary
trade-off, we will not "act now," and therefore we will build inhumane AI
systems. So while there are still Open Source deck chairs to rearrange---slop
PRs (Mitchell is [on it](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch)), perennial
sustainability challenges (finally getting solved with
[Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/) and
[Endowment](https://endowment.dev/))---I am now also committing myself to
disembarking from the titantic of technological accelerationism.

I have started returning to a pre-screen, analog life. What does this mean?
Consider four levels of increasing human autonomy:

1. <b>The Baby Step</b>---Leave your phone in the kitchen on Sunday night instead of sleeping with it. Wake up without it on Monday morning.
1. <b>[Analog Sunday](https://www.analogsunday.co/)</b>---Detach from the machine all day, once a week. My friend Julian Cisneros is growing this movement.
1. <b>Screen Time/Bean Time</b>---Silly name my daughter and I came up with for using screens professionally, detaching in private life. Unplugged outside of work/school. Calls but no texting. It gets real because we have to go back to old ways of communicating, finding information, navigating, accounting, etc. **This is where I'm at today.**
1. <b>Analog Economy</b>---Some avoid the machine in their professional life as well. I'm not there and see no clear path, but ...

### Introducing _Gift_ Magazine

I'm launching a print magazine called _Gift_ to contribute to the conversation
about escaping the machine. I'm framing it as an Orthodox Christian
contribution to the Great Analog Reset. I intend for the first issue to be an
essay laying out my vision. To receive a copy, write to:

Gift  
P.O. Box 200  
Sewickley, PA   
15143-0200  
USA

Suggested donation is $5 cash or check (or rough equivalent in your local
currency). Be sure to include a return address or otherwise specify where 
to send it.

I don't plan to promote _Gift_ online beyond this post. I'll go back to
shuffling Open Source deck chairs ... but in my off-hours I hope to become
increasingly Homeless.
