This is my contribution to the (ongoing) [Great WordPress Drama of
2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP_Engine#WordPress_dispute_and_lawsuit).
Here are explainers from [Ivan Mehta in
_TechCrunch_](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/10/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/)
and [Emma Roth in _The
Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262232/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-org-wp-engine)
to get caught up. Adam Jacob is thorough as usual on [the trademark
angle](https://x.com/adamhjk/status/1844043758800957727). Pelle Wessman [gets
closer](https://x.com/voxpelli/status/1844346017879294449) to what I see as the
heart of the matter:

> WordPress has given the impression that they are a community owned project
> with WordPress Foundation guaranteeing its independence from any one actor.
>
> But now its become apparent that WordPress Foundation is not.

Yes, this episode reveals much about the importance of governance in Open
Source.  Even more than that, however, it reveals the importance of
_leadership_.

## Matt Mullenweg Is a Tragic Tyrant

Matt Mullenweg's behavior during this crisis is difficult for me not to
interpret through [the lens of Greek
tragedy](https://brill.com/view/journals/agpt/40/2/article-p234_5.xml):

> The negative meaning of _tyrannos_ ["tyrant"] is always latent in [Greek] tragedy, even
> where the word is used objectively and not as a term of abuse. _Tyrannos_ does
> not simply indicate a powerful individual but implies absolute power, fortune
> and wealth. This absolute power leads to ruin and tyrannical vice. _Tyrannos_
> signifies not a bad or illegitimate ruler, but rather one with the potential
> to develop such characteristics.

Against that backdrop, consider the hubris:

- "[I've been post-economic for probably 19 years
now.](https://x.com/sereedmedia/status/1839394786622722432)"

- "[WordPress.org just belongs to me personally.](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262232/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-org-wp-engine)"

- "[People think they're a lot more important than they actually are.](https://x.com/photomatt/status/1844188190061756918)"

The [targeted expansion](https://archive.is/TWjAr):

> The abbreviation 'WP' is not covered by the WordPress trademarks, but please
> don’t use it in a way that confuses people. For example, many people think WP
> Engine is 'WordPress Engine' and officially associated with WordPress, which
> it’s not.

The thin skin: "[My own mother was confused.](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/)"

The shakedown: "[a royalty fee equal to 8% of its Gross Revenue](https://automattic.com/2024/10/01/wpe-terms/)."

And then, the "[Automattic Alignment](https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment/)," the
demand of allegiance:

- "[I ask everyone in the WordPress community to <b>vote with your
wallet</b>.](https://ma.tt/2024/09/ecosystem-thinking/)"

- "[If you want to experience WordPress, use any other host in the world besides
WP Engine.](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine-banned/)"

- "[I want you all to be informed and involved. Not to stay on the
sidelines](https://x.com/JavierCasares/status/1843963086073733523)."

And finally, **The Checkbox&trade;**. Yes, it's [really
there](https://login.wordpress.org/) ([archive](https://archive.is/FqfEr)), and
[you have to check it](https://x.com/chadwhitacre_/status/1844483081413214647) to login.

WP Engine
[alleges](https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cease-and-Desist-Letter-to-Automattic-and-Request-to-Preserve-Documents-Sent.pdf)
that Matt "threatened [...] to embark on a self-described 'scorched earth
nuclear approach,'" if they didn't resolve their conflict before his WordCamp
keynote. Whether the specific allegation is true, that certainly describes what
has transpired since. Matt himself calls it "[going to
war](https://ma.tt/2024/09/charitable-contributions/)." His keynote is his
"[Spiciest WordCamp Talk
Ever!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnI-QcVSwMU#t=10m05s)" It [immediately
sent the community
reeling](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1flqqm5/matt_just_threw_wp_engine_under_the_bus_hard/)
and [the](https://x.com/LinuxJedi/status/1843966957495939093)

[soon](https://x.com/LucP/status/1843926970763227255).

Moreover, Matt's current behavior is in keeping with his past behavior. Wes Bos
[pointed out](https://x.com/wesbos/status/1839122560597848533), "Real ones
remember the @photomatt and @pearsonified thesis theme spat of." I'm not a real
one so I had to [read up on
it](https://poststatus.com/thesis-automattic-and-wordpress/). Vicious, highly
public conflict seems to be part of Matt's _modus operandi_, part of his
character as a leader.


## Dries Buytaert Is a Gentle Giant

{% include img.html src="./dries-and-matt.jpg" url="https://dri.es/two-internet-entrepreneurs-walk-into-an-old-publishing-house" caption="Dries and Matt in 2019, from Dries' blog. CC-BY-NC" %}

In the heat of the WordPress drama, it's easy to forget that there's another GPL
PHP CMS powering a good chunk of the other 57% of the Web: Drupal. Its founder,
Dries Buytaert, [has all the answers to resolve the WordPress
crisis](https://dri.es/solving-the-maker-taker-problem). No joke.

Dries work with Drupal is [a master-class in institution-building for governing
the
commons](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source).
Elinor Ostrom [wrote the book on this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1107569788),
which [I summarized in an early
post](https://openpath.quest/2024/the-case-for-a-new-institution/#a-commons-is-an-institution).
The summary of the summary is that healthy commons exhibit seven attributes:

1. Clearly defined boundaries
1. Congruence between appropriation and provision rules and local conditions
1. Collective-choice arrangements
1. Monitoring
1. Graduated sanctions
1. Conflict-resolution mechanisms
1. Minimal recognition of rights to organize

Drupal exhibits all of these, because Dries [explicitly grew Drupal according
to the best research on governing the
commons](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source).
The Drupal Association is a truly independent, credible non-profit. Dries'
company Acquia is one company among many operating on equal terms. The Drupal
community has evolved a complex system of non-monetary accounting for
contributions to the Drupal project, with the Association trusted to carry out
monitoring and enforcement. [Go read Dries' deep dive from five years
ago](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source).
It's awesome.

What's more, Dries' irenic tone is exceedingly refreshing. From his [latest](https://dri.es/solving-the-maker-taker-problem):

> Although this post was prompted by the controversy between Automattic and WP
> Engine, it is _not_ about them. I don't have insight into their respective
> contributions to WordPress, and I'm not here to judge. I've made an effort to
> keep this post as neutral as possible.

He just comes across as a really good guy, who has done a lot of really great
work with Drupal and genuinely wants to see others succeed. When he says he
considers Matt a good friend, I believe him.  If I see hope for WordPress, it's
that peers such as Dries Buytaert [and David Heinemeier
Hansson](https://x.com/dhh/status/1843783918270722383) (DHH) are able to get
through to Matt with constructive feedback leading to personal growth.


## More Good Leaders, Please

I think Matt is right that WP Engine is hurting the WordPress community. From
here in the peanut gallery, it does seem like WP Engine is rapaciously—and
rationally!—strip-mining the WordPress community. As we wrestle with the
questions of trademarks and licensing and sustainability and funding and
governance in Open Source that this situation presents, let's not forget about
leadership.

For better or worse, organizations and institutions and communities have
leaders. For better or worse, leaders put their stamp on the groups they lead,
often in subtle and far-reaching ways. All leaders make mistakes. Nobody is
perfect. (I know from personal experience. ;-) Personal growth is deeply ...
personal.

If Matt wants a true Open Source community, he should follow Dries' advice and
make the WordPress Foundation truly independent of Automattic. If that's not
what he wants, he should be honest about it. We invented [Fair
Source](https://fair.io/) precisely for companies who want to share to an
extent while maintaining control over their core software products.

Maybe DHH is [right](https://world.hey.com/dhh/automattic-is-doing-open-source-dirty-b95cf128):

> I suspect Automattic wants to have their cake and eat it too. They want to
> retain WordPress' shine of open source, but also be able to extract their
> pound of flesh from any competitor that might appear, whenever they see fit.

But maybe Matt will be able to pull back from the tyrant's path that he is on,
and embark instead on a path to deeper growth as a leader.
